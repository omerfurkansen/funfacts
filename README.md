# An example one-page app created with React named as FunFacts

Hello there ðŸ‘‹ This is an example of a one-page application that I made, and please feel free to contact me via email! This program allows you to view the date, check the weather, explore the world through map, and learn new things about adorable animals, space, and numbers. This website was developed to entertain you and bring a smile to your face. ðŸ˜Š I utilized free open APIs to create this webpage, and I have no idea how lengthy each paragraph might be, thus the content sizes may change, be patient some images my tight a bit longer to download though. Fully responsive, please visit the page along your mobile device as well!
